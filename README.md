# Exploratory data analysis Iris Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib starts by loading the dataset and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation. Summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, can be quickly obtained using describe() to understand the central tendencies and spread of the features (sepal and petal measurements). Visualizations are crucial in EDA, and using Seaborn's pairplot() allows us to examine pairwise relationships between features, highlighting any patterns or distinctions among the three species. Additionally, box plots and histograms can further reveal the distribution of individual features and potential outliers. Scatter plots and correlation matrices can then provide deeper insights into how the features are interrelated.

# Predicting employee Atrrition
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for predicting employee attrition using Python, begin by importing the necessary libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Load the employee dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate data manipulation. Display the first few rows and check for missing values to assess data quality. Use summary statistics to understand distributions of numerical features. Visualize the data with count plots to show attrition distribution, box plots to compare salaries by attrition status, and correlation heatmaps to identify relationships among features. This analysis will help highlight key factors influencing employee attrition.
